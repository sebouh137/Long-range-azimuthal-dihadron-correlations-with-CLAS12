\section{Event Mixing}
The mixed event sample was produced combining the electron and pion in a ``trigger'' event with a hadron from another event (the ``associated'' event).  Both the trigger event and the associated event were required to have a DIS electron and a hadron which satisfy the requirements in Sec.~\ref{sec:eventselection}.  For the trigger event, the hadron was required to be a pion with at least $z>0.4$. However, neither the trigger event nor the associated event were required to have more than one hadron.  


All kinematic variables that depend on the associated hadron's kinematics and also the kinematics of the electron and/or trigger pion were recalculated using the kinematics of the associated hadron of the associated event and the electron and trigger pion of the trigger event.  Such variables include $z_2$, $\phi^{\rm cm}_2$, $\Delta\phi_{\rm cm}$, $m_{\rm pair}$, etc.
